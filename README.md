## Description
DESCRIPTION

This project was designed and created with the employer in mind. Whether large or small, you need to know exactly what (and how much) you will be paying our overall. One of the largest, if not the largest expenses an employer will encounter. 

This program allows for employees to be entered in a one at-a-time manner. The program will accept the users first name, last name, employee id #, job title, and annual salary. The program will summate the annual expenses of any employees that have been entered into the application and convert that summation into a monthly total expense and display it under the table of employees.
